      <h3 id="headline">A few of Alan Turing's accomplishments and contributions to modern computing and AI.</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1912</strong> Born in Maida Vale, London, England</li>
        <li><strong>1931-1934</strong> Attends King's College, Cambridge where he wins first-class honors in mathematics.</li>
        <li><strong>1936</strong> Publishes "On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem." This paper is the inception of Turing Machines, later known as the original concept of a modern computer, and is hailed as "easily the most influential math paper in history".
        </li>
        <li><strong>1936-1938</strong> Attends Princeton to obtain his PhD. There he studied cyptology and built three of four stages of an electro-mechanical binary multiplyer. He also introduced the concepts of ordinal log and relative computing.</li>
        <li><strong>1939 </strong> Turing solves the essential part of the naval indicator system, which was more complex than the indicator systems used by the other services. The same night he delivered that information, he also conceived the idea of Banburismus, which would later assist in breaking the Naval Enigma code. </li>
        <li><strong>1946</strong>  Appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) by King George VI. It is said that Turing's contributions to the war saved over 14 million lives.</li>
        <li><strong>1954</strong> Turing is found dead in his flat by his housekeeper. Later it would be determined that cyanide was the cause of his death. Next to his body laid a half eaten apple. Some believe the apple was the carrier of the fatal dose.
      </ul>

          “It seems probable that once the machine thinking method had started, it would not take long to outstrip our feeble powers… They would be able to converse with each other to sharpen their wits. At some stage therefore, we should have to expect the machines to take control.”
